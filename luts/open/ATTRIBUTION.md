## `kodak_gold_200.png`

Baked from the **spektrafilm** film profile `kodak_gold_200` — a spectral
photochemical simulation built from measured film datasheet density curves and
spectral sensitivities, not a hand-tuned approximation.

### What was changed

Baked to a level-8 HaldCLUT PNG (512×512, 64³ cube), sRGB in and sRGB out, with
the print profile `kodak_portra_endura` (which is the value of the Gold 200
profile's own `target_print` field).

One parameter was deliberately changed from spektrafilm's default:

    stops_above_midgray = 2.47      (spektrafilm's default is "auto", i.e. 4.0)

sRGB's native headroom above mid-grey is `log2(1.0 / 0.18) = 2.47` stops. That
is the physically honest value for a display-referred input. spektrafilm defaults
to 4.0 as a deliberate aesthetic choice — its own documentation calls it "an
aesthetic interpretation, not a measurement" — so that encoded 1.0 lands on the
film's shoulder and the rolloff engages on already-rendered SDR sources.

Measured, at 4.0 that default lifts mid-grey from 0.500 to **0.779** — over a
stop of brightening applied to every photograph. At 2.47 mid-grey lands at 0.506.
Since this project's pipeline already does its own exposure and highlight rolloff
before the LUT, the LUT's job here is colour, not exposure. Hence 2.47.

### Why this file is not MIT

The rest of this repository is MIT. This file is not, and cannot be.

spektrafilm's code is GPLv3 and its profile data is CC BY-SA 4.0, and its license
addresses this exact case explicitly:

> This license applies to the original spektrafilm profiles … **and to all direct
> derivatives of the profiles, such as copies in other projects, LUTs, or any
> other format that encodes the same content.** LUTs and similar artifacts are
> interpreted as direct encodings of the information in the original profiles.

A LUT baked from a profile is therefore that profile's data in a different
container, and it carries the profile's license. So this directory is a
per-directory license carve-out: **CC BY-SA 4.0, with attribution, share-alike.**

**Photographs you make with it are yours.** No copyleft reaches your images —
only the LUT file itself and anything that re-encodes the same table.
